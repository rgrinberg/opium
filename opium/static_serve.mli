(** Middleware serves all files (recursively) in the [local_path] directory
    under the [uri_prefix] url.  The responses contain a [Content-type]
    header that is auto-detected based on the file extension using the
    {!Magic_mime.lookup} function. Additional headers can be provided through
    [headers].

    If [etag_of_fname] is provided, the response will contain an [ETag] header.
    If the request contains an [If-None-Match] header with an [ETag] equal to
    that generated by [etag_of_fname], this middleware will respond with [304
    Not Modified]. *)
