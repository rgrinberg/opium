## Executive Summary

Sinatra like web toolkit for OCaml based on [cohttp](https://github.com/avsm/ocaml-cohttp/), [core](https://github.com/janestreet/core), & [lwt](https://github.com/ocsigen/lwt)

## Design Goals

* Opium should be very small and easily learnable. A programmer should
be instantly productive when starting out.

* Opium should be extendable using indepedently developed
plugins. This is a _Rack_ inspired mechanism borrowed from Ruby. The
middleware mechanism in Opium is called `Rock`.

* It should maximize use of creature comforts people are used to in
other languages. Such as [sexplib](https://github.com/janestreet/sexplib), [fieldslib](https://github.com/janestreet/fieldslib), [cow](https://github.com/mirage/ocaml-cow), a decent
standard library.

## Installation

__NOTE__: At this point there's a good chance this library will only
work against cohttp master. Once cohttp 1.0 is released then this
library will always be developed against OPAM version.

### Stable

The latest stable version is available on opam

```
$ opam install opium
```

### Master

If you'd like to live on the bleeding edge (which is sometimes more stable than
stable)

```
$ opam pin add opium --dev-repo
```

## Examples

### Hello World

Here's a simple hello world example to get your feet wet:

`$ cat hello_world.ml`

``` ocaml
open Core_kernel.Std
open Opium.Std

type person = {
  name: string;
  age: int;
}

let json_of_person { name ; age } =
  let open Ezjsonm in
  dict [ "name", (string name)
       ; "age", (int age) ]

let print_param = put "/hello/:name" begin fun req ->
  `String ("Hello " ^ param req "name") |> respond'
end

let print_person = get "/person/:name/:age" begin fun req ->
  let person = {
    name = param req "name";
    age = "age" |> param req |> Int.of_string;
  } in
  `Json (person |> json_of_person |> Ezjsonm.wrap) |> respond'
end

let _ =
  App.empty
  |> print_param
  |> print_person
  |> Runtime.run_command
```

compile with:
```
$ corebuild -pkg opium,cow.syntax hello_world.native
```

### Middleware

The two fundamental building blocks of opium are:

* Handlers: `Rock.Request.t -> Rock.Response.t Deferred.t`
* Middleware: `Rock.Handler.t -> Rock.Handler.t`

Almost every all of opium's functionality is assembled through various
middleware. For example: debugging, routing, serving static files,
etc. Creating middleware is usually the most natural way to extend an
opium app.

Here's how you'd create a simple middleware turning away everyone's
favourite browser.

``` ocaml
open Core_kernel.Std
open Opium.Std
(* don't open cohttp and opium since they both define
   request/response modules*)

let is_substring ~substring s =
  Option.is_some (String.substr_index s ~pattern:substring)

let reject_ua ~f =
  let filter handler req =
    match Cohttp.Header.get (Request.headers req) "user-agent" with
    | Some ua when f ua ->
      `String ("Please upgrade your browser") |> respond'
    | _ -> handler req in
  Rock.Middleware.create ~filter ~name:(Info.of_string "reject_ua")

let _ = App.empty
        |> get "/" (fun req -> `String ("Hello World") |> respond')
        |> middleware (reject_ua ~f:(is_substring ~substring:"MSIE"))
        |> App.cmd_name "Reject UA"
        |> Runtime.run_command

```

Compile with:

```
$ corebuild -pkg opium middleware_ua.native
```

Here we also use the ability of Opium to generate a cmdliner term to run your
app. Run your executable with the `-h` to see the options that are available to
you. For example:

```
# run in debug mode on port 9000
$ ./middleware_ua.native -p 9000 -d
```
