## Things missing when compared to version based on Cohttp

* No cookie module (will need something similar to Cohttp's cookie module)
* No SSL (https://github.com/inhabitedtype/httpaf/pull/83 should help)
* No websocket (work in progress in https://github.com/inhabitedtype/httpaf/pull/159)

Update this file as more gaps are found
